        <pre>Flowers are introduced as the reproductive part of a plant. They are not only involved in reproduction but are also a source of food for other living organisms. They are a rich source of nectar.

            Flowers can either be
            
            1.Complete
            2.Incomplete.
            A complete flower is one that consists of sepals, petals, stamens and pistils.
             On the contrary, an incomplete flower is one that lacks one or more of these structures.
            
            A complete flower consists of two different parts:
            
            Vegetative Part
            Reproductive Part</pre>
